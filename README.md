# MIS670_Final

## Social Media Analytics Capstone Project
This repository contains all associated code and files used for the Kansas State University MIS 670 course (Fall 2018 Semester). 

Network Analytics were completed in Gephi, but the code that compiled the datasets to be imported and used within the program is contained within this dataset as well. The generated images of the networks have been included in this repository.
